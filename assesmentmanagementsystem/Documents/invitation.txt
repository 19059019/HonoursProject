You are invited to take part in a study conducted by Michael Shepherd, from the Computer Science Division at Stellenbosch University. You were approached as a possible participant because you are a student of Scientific Computing 272.

The purpose of this study is to create a simple and intuitive submission system for the Stellenbosch University Computer Science Division. The submission system is a part of a larger honours project that is part of the researchers honours degree.

What Will be Asked of Me?

If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to submit an assessment through the given submission system. If you do make a submission, a linked to a google form for feedback will be emailed to you.

If there is an issue or you do not wish to participate in the study:

The existing submission system will be available at all times. You will not be penalised in
any way if you choose to use the existing submission system rather than this project. If you wish 
to withdraw from the testing of this software, you will need to rather use the existing submission
to submit this assignment. Any student who wishes to withdraw will encounter no negative
consequences as long as they proceed to submit the assignment in question through the existing
system.

Researchersâ€™ Contact Information:

If you encounter any issues with the submission system or have any questions or concerns about this study, please feel free to contact Michael Shepherd at 19059019@sun.ac.za
